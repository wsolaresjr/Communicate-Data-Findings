# A Visualization for Ford GoBike

## Dataset

> Provide basic information about your dataset in this section. If you selected your own dataset, make sure you note the source of your data and summarize any data wrangling steps that you performed before you started your exploration.
The dataset I decided to use is the FordGo Bike Dataset. The data itself provides the following data information: Trip Duration (seconds), Start Time and Date, End Time and Date, Start Station ID, Start Station Name, Start Station Latitude, Start Station Longitude, End Station ID, End Station Name, End Station Latitude, End Station Longitude, Bike ID, User Type (Subscriber or Customer – “Subscriber” = Member or Customer” = Casual), Member Year of Birth, and Member Gender. The various things that could be done with this dataset are vast to say the least, but my focus after seeing the kind of dataset it is, is to see the variation of the Age, Gender, and User Type. The steps I took to begin was to upload all the datasets within a year time frame, as each dataset comes with only a months worth, and merge them to one. Once merged together there wasn't too much of the data I had to fix. Changing the birth year to the integer and creating columns for month, weekdays, and hours were the biggest issue here. Once that was set my exploration was ready to begin.



## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.
After viewing the data and the type of data provided, I decided to explore the dataset in terms of Age, Gender, and time of use. In the Univariate portion of the visualization we see a steady age of riders go from expected age ranges to some not so expected, that being above 80. This data may be incorrect, but we have no proof to deny these users are real. I have seen bike riders at the age of 70 in Japan.
    After getting the visualizations from the age groups of which ages use it the most we see in the Bivariate exploration that the age group of users are between 20 to 40 years old. This in turn gives us a lot of reliable data as it seems this is the prime age group of the working class that rely on this form of transportation. We also notice a decline of usage between November to April, I assume the cold weather.
    This brings me to my last visualization of Multivariate exploration. Are subscribers, Customers, Gender, and Age making a difference in usage here? The answer is yes, we see that most of the users are actually Male Subscribers and Customers. There are alot more Subscribers then Customers which in turn is great for the business.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Some key insights that'll be shown is the age, gender and the user type. We see Subcribers and Customers between the ages 20 to 40 are the most frequest users of Fords GoBike. This is beneficial for the city as we will notice less traffic, better air quality, and much more productivity. The biggest downfall noticed is between the months November to April there is a decline in usage by about half. Overall, it seems like a healthy use of transportation.
